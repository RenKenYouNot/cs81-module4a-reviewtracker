The most helpful part of this code's structure was how each task, like adding books and calculating totals, 
was broken down into its own function. This made it much easier to understand what each section of the code was doing.

What took me a little longer to understand was how all the functions were accessing and changing the same readingLog data, 
since it's a global variable. It made me think more about how data flows through the program.
